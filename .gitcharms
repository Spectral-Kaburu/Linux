# Ever wanted to have a file saved in another dir and still be connected
# to your repo??

# Welcome to my small implementation of my solution called git charms

# A command(function && git alias), links to repo-dir .git, ensuring
# that whatever arguments parsed work just like git in repo-dir

# GIT_WORK_TREE - choose between, file(may have damning consequences)
#		  and repo-dir(Recommended) location

# I just found out U could tab git commands for completion!!
# It's a must-have capability - see after func.
