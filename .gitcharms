## Problems:
# 1) Ever wanted to have a file saved in another dir and still be connected
#    to your repo?? (.gitalien)

# source ~/.gitalien

# If you wondered hard enough, or explored problem (1) you would end up
# at another problem;

# 2) Can I blacklist some files to be tracked in a folder in github without
#    necessarily having the file within the dir locally? (.gitpatch).

source ~/.gitpatch

# 3) I'm lazy, you probably are too, what if U could have your git commands 
#    chaotically stacked? (.gitchaos)

# source ~/.gitchaos


## Welcome to my small implementation of my solutions called gitcharms


## gitalien solution:

# A command(function && git alias), links to repo-dir .git, ensuring
# that whatever arguments parsed work just like git in repo-dir

# GIT_WORK_TREE - choose between, file(may have damning consequences)
#		  and repo-dir(Recommended) location

# I just found out U could tab git commands for completion!!
# It's a must-have capability - see after func.

# There are some caveats.

# It only works for adding commiting and pushing(far as I've tested)
# It only adds a file if it's in the current dir.
# DO NOT pull, as this will create a .git on your home dir
# if U check status U might worry, as it checks the current-dir
